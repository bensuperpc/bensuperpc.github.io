Guide to SFF PCs\nWelcome to the guide to SFF PCs.\nIntroduction to SFF PCs\nIn this section, we will explore different aspects of SFF PCs, including their components and software, with a focus on Linux and open-source solutions, Windows have often lower lifetime support and proprietary software.\nWhat is an SFF PC?\nAn SFF PC is a Small Form Factor PC, it is usually very compact, power-efficient, and can be used for various purposes, they are commonly found in schools, offices, and home servers.\nWhy should I choose an SFF PC?\nThere are many reasons to choose an SFF PC:\n\nCompact: SFF PCs are very small and can fit almost anywhere. (~1-3 liters)\nPower-efficient: They consume less power, especially models with T or U series processors.\nAffordable: SFF PCs are often cheaper than traditional full desktop PCs, especially on the second-hand market.\n\nWhy shouldn't I choose an SFF PC?\nThere are also some drawbacks to consider:\n\nLimited upgradeability: Many SFF PCs have limited upgrade options, and some components are not replaceable.\nFewer ports: Compared to larger desktops, SFF PCs typically have fewer connectivity options.\nPerformance constraints: Due to their small size and thermal limitations, performance may be lower than full-sized PCs.\nProprietary components: Some models use proprietary parts, making repairs and upgrades more difficult.\n\nWhat are some examples of SFF PCs?\nHere are some well-known brands and models:\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre: M73 Tiny, M710q, M720q, M70q gen 1, M75q gen 1, M90q gen 3\nDell OptiPlex: 3040, 3050, 3060, 3070, 5040, 5050, 5060, 5070\nHP EliteDesk: 800 G1 Mini, 800 G2 Mini\nIntel NUC: NUC6i3SYH, NUC6i5SYH, NUC6i7KYK, NUC7i3BNH, NUC7i5BNH, NUC7i7BNH\nZotac ZBOX: CI660 Nano, CI640 Nano, CI620 Nano, CI540 Nano, CI520 Nano, CI327 Nano\nAsus VivoMini: UN65, UN65U, UN65U-M023M, UN65U-M021M, UN65U-M022M, UN65U-M020M\n\nMany other brands and models are available on the market.\nFor second-hand options, i recommend Lenovo, Dell, and HP. These brands offer plenty of affordable models that are often upgradable (RAM, SSD, CPU, PSU) and great Linux compatibility.\nARM SFF PCs\nSFF PCs are usually x86-based, but ARM-based SFF PCs have been gaining popularity in recent years, they are generally cheaper and more power-efficient but come with limitations:\n\nLimited software compatibility: They are not compatible with traditional x86/PC software and drivers can be missing or outdated.\nLimited upgrade options: Components are often soldered and non-replaceable.\nLower performance: Compared to x86 counterparts, ARM-based SFF PCs may struggle with demanding tasks (encoding, gaming, etc.).\n\nIn this guide, we will focus on x86 SFF PCs and the Raspberry Pi.\nSFF PC Components\nIn this section, we will look at the main components of SFF PCs.\nCPU (Central Processing Unit)\nI recommend using socketed CPUs, as they allow for future upgrades to more powerful models (within the same TDP range), for example on Thinkcentre tiny M720q, you can upgrade from a slow Intel Celeron G4900T to a powerful Intel i9-9900T without any issues (somtime just need update of Intel ME and BIOS).\nMost SFF PCs come with 35W or 65W CPUs, i strongly recommend avoiding CPUs with a higher TDP than what the system supports, as this can cause overheating and potentially damage the motherboard or PSU.\nMany modern software utilizes AVX2 instructions, which can significantly boost performance in tasks like video encoding/decoding, compression, encryption, etc. Every CPU since Intel Haswell (2013) and AMD Zen (2017) supports AVX2, except for some low-end models like Intel Celeron/Pentium/Atom and AMD Athlon.\nIntel CPU generations\nBrandCPU archCPU GenSocketRAM TypeMax RAMYearExemple of SSF PCRemarks\nintelCoreCore 2LGA775DDR2-DDR38GB2006-2007Huge performance improvement over Netburst\nintelPenrynCore 2LGA775DDR2-DDR38GB2007-2008Better perf efficiency\nintelNehalem1st GenLGA1156DDR316GB2008-2009SMT, Memory controller on CPU and monolithic quad-core\nintelWestmere1st GenLGA1156DDR316GB2010-2011Better perf efficiency\nintelSandy Bridge2nd GenLGA1155DDR332GB2011-2012M72 tinyAdd AVX support, good iGPU and greatly improve perf\nintelIvy Bridge3rd GenLGA1155DDR332GB2012-2013M72 tinyBetter perf efficiency\nintelHaswell4th GenLGA1150DDR332GB2013-2014M73 tinySupport AVX2 and FMA3, improve perf\nintelBroadwell5th GenLGA1150DDR332GB2014-2015Better perf efficiency\nintelSkylake6th GenLGA1151DDR3-DDR464GB2015-2016M700, M710qHEVC/VP9 8-bit hardware enc/dec, iGPU vulkan and NVMe support\nintelKaby Lake7th GenLGA1151DDR464GB2016-2017M710qHEVC/VP9 10-bit hardware enc/dec support\nintelCoffee Lake8-9th GenLGA1151DDR464GB2017-2019M720qIncrease core count and remove SMT on 9th gen CPUs\nintelComet Lake10th GenLGA1200DDR4128GB2020-2021M70q gen 1Re-add SMT on most CPUs\nintelRocket Lake11th GenLGA1200DDR4128GB2021-2022M70q gen 2Add AVX-512 support and better perf\nintelAlder Lake12th GenLGA1700DDR4-DDR5256GB2021-2022M70q gen 3Remove AVX-512, Pcore and ECore, AV1 hard dec and improve IPC\nintelRaptor Lake13-14th GenLGA1700DDR5256GB2022-2023M70q gen 4, 5More Ecores and cache\nintelArrow Lake15th GenLGA1700DDR5256GB2024-2025M70q gen 6Remove SMT, gain big perf per thread, AV1 encode, Ray Tracing\nintelNova Lake16th GenLGA1851DDR5?2026 ?(Re)add AVX10.2/AVX512 support\n\nAMD CPU generations\nBrandCPU archCPU GenSocketRAM TypeMax RAMYearExemple of SSF PCRemarks\nAMDExcavator4th GenAM4DDR432GB2015-2016\nAMDZen1st GenAM4DDR464GB2017-2018M715QHuge performance improvement and on pair with intel Haswell CPUs\nAMDZen+2nd GenAM4DDR464GB2018-2019\nAMDZen 23rd GenAM4DDR4128GB2019-2020M70q gen 1/2On pair with intel Skylake CPUs and fix most of the issues of Zen\nAMDZen 34th GenAM4DDR4128GB2020-2021M70q gen 2Improve IPC and power efficiency\nAMDZen 45th GenAM5DDR5128GB2021-2022Add AVX-512 support, better IPC and RDNA iGPU\nAMDZen 56th GenAM5DDR5192GB2022-2023M70q gen 5Slightly improve IPC and AVX-512 support perf\n\nI recommend using Intel Alder Lake, AMD Zen 3, or newer CPUs, they offer nice performances and support modern features like NVMe, iGPU Vulkan, HEVC 10-bit hardware encoding/decoding, AVX2, etc... However, if you’re on a budget, Intel Coffee Lake, AMD Zen 2 remains a good option due to the low price of the CPUs and relatively good performance, older CPUs like Intel Haswell and AMD Excavator often not worth it due to their low performance, lack of modern features (NVMe, HEVC or Vulkan etc...) and microcode updates (security and bug fix for CPU).\nGPU (Graphics Processing Unit)\nMost SFF PCs have only an integrated GPU, they are sufficient for light GPU tasks and are very power efficient, some SFF PCs can add a dedicated GPU (like M720Q/M920Q), these are low-profile and use PCIe x4/x8 lanes, which can be useful for light gaming, networking, etc... Ensure the PSU and motherboard can support the PCIe card's power consumption.\nI recommend Intel iGPUs from Skylake or newer (Intel HD 500 series and newer) or AMD iGPUs from Zen 2 or newer (Vega and newer).\nThese GPUs support modern graphics APIs such as OpenGL 4.6 and Vulkan (up to 1.4 on Linux via Mesa), and provide hardware acceleration for common video codecs like AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VP9.\nAV1 hardware decoding is available on Intel Alder Lake or newer, and on AMD RDNA2/Zen 4-based iGPUs or newer, for encoding, Intel Arc GPUs, Arrow lake or AMD RDNA3-based GPUs are required.\nVulkan (1.3/1.4) has become increasingly important in recent years, especially with the emergence of Vulkan Video extensions, which aim to improve efficiency by reducing CPU overhead compared to traditional APIs such as VA-API or VDPAU.\nRAM (Random Access Memory)\nSFF PCs typically have two RAM slots, supporting DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5 RAM depending on the CPU and motherboard, the maximum capacity usually ranges from 16GB to 256GB, i recommend using two identical RAM sticks to enable dual-channel (double the bandwidth), you can use higher-frequency RAM than what the CPU officially supports, the RAM will downclock to maximum supported frequency by memory controller.\nMost SSF PCs support SO-DIMM (RAM in Laptop), which is smaller than standard DIMM RAM, but they have similar performances.\nI recommend using DDR4 or DDR5 RAM, as it is the most common, well-supported, here are some general recommendations (in 2025):\n\n4GB: Barebones Linux server, light applications. (small website hosting, router, NAS)\n8GB: Light to medium applications. (web browsing, office work, small servers)\n16GB: Recommended for most use cases. (basic game server, CI build server, light development)\n32GB+: Optimal for multitasking. (AAA gaming, video/photo editing, rendering)\n64GB+: Heavy multitasking. (virtualization, machine learning, scientific computing, CAD)\n\nStorage\nSFF PCs have four main storage options (depending on the model):\n\nM.2 NVMe SSD: Very fast and present in most SFF PCs since 2015, the best choice.\nM.2 SATA SSD: Uses the same connector as NVMe but operates at SATA speeds. (e.g., ThinkCentre M700)\n2.5\" SATA SSD: Slower than M.2 NVMe but a good alternative if M.2 is unavailable.\n2.5\" SATA HDD: Very slow and generally not recommended, but can be replaced with an SSD.\nOnboard eMMC: Soldered storage on the motherboard, avoid it, it is slow, limited and non-replaceable.\n\nI recommend using M.2 NVMe SSDs, be mindful of the size (2242, 2260, 2280), connector type (B, M, B+M), and whether it's single or double-sided.\nYou can use SSDs PCIe 4.0 x4 on PCIe 3.0 x2 or x4 slots and vice versa, the SSD will automatically adjust to the maximum speed supported by both parts.\nPorts\nAll SFF PCs have a limited number of ports, ensure that your chosen SFF PC has enough ports for your needs, some models support expansion for additional ports (most Lenovo ThinkCentre tiny models).\nCommon ports include:\n\nUSB type A: For peripherals, storage, mouse, keyboard, etc...\nUSB type C: Same as USB type A, sometimes video output and/or thunderbolt support\nHDMI/DisplayPort/VGA: For monitors\nEthernet: For networking\nAudio jacks: For headphones, microphones, speakers\n\nPSU (Power Supply Unit)\nMost SFF PCs use an external power supply, often with a proprietary connector.\nHere are general guidelines:\n\n45W: 15W CPU\n65W: 35W CPU\n90W: 65W CPU or 35W CPU + DVD drive/expansion\n135W: 65W CPU + 45W GPU or 100W CPU\n\nYou can gain small performance boosts by using an overpowered PSU, especially since Intel Commet Lake and newer CPUs.\nMotherboard\nLike the PSU, most SFF PCs have a proprietary motherboard, sometimes, you can replace it with another model from the same brand (e.g., an M920Q motherboard in an M720Q), however, in most cases, it is best to stick with the original motherboard model.\nOperating System\nAll SFF PCs x86-based are compatible with most operating systems (Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, even MacOS x86 etc...), i strongly recommend using Linux or FreeBSD due to its low resource usage, better performance, security, and compatibility with older hardware, some Linux distributions i recommend for SFF PCs.\nStandard Linux distributions:\n\nDebian: Stable, well-supported, large software repository, update cycle of ~2 years\nUbuntu: User-friendly, large community, based on Debian with GNOME desktop\nArch Linux: Rolling release and cutting-edge software, highly customizable but high learning curve\nNixOS: Fully declarative and reproducible configuration, unique package management system\n\nLightweight Linux distributions:\n\nLubuntu: Ubuntu with LXQt GUI\nXubuntu: Ubuntu with XFCE GUI\nStitaz: Extremely lightweight, can run on very old hardware but old kernels and software.\n\nMultimedia-focused Linux distributions:\n\nOSMC: Lightweight media center distribution based on Debian\n\nLenovo thinkcentre SSF PCs\nIn this section, we will see the different models of Lenovo thinkcentre SSF PCs.\nModelCPUChipsetSODIMM RAM³PCIe2.5\" Satam.2 NVMePSREF\nM72 tinyivy bridgeIntel

small sample project based on Google Test, but the method is also compatible with other frameworks such as Catch2, Boost.Test, or Doctest.\nMinimum Requirements\n\nCMake 3.15\nGCC or Clang (C++17)\nGoogle Test (GTest)\nGCOVR 5.0\nNinja (optional, but recommended)\n\nA distribution like Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12 or higher is recommended for this tutorial, but you can use any Linux distribution with the required versions of the tools.\nInstalling Dependencies\nTo install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following commands:\nFor Ubuntu/Debian :\n\nFor Fedora :\n\nFor Arch Linux :\n\nWhat is GCOVR?\nGCOVR is an open-source tool that generates C/C++ code coverage reports from the data produced during test execution.\nSample Project\nThe sample project is a simple application and two C++ libraries, one for mathematics and one for physics.\nHere is the project structure:\n\nYou can download the sample project: \n\n    tuto_coverage.7z\n\nCompilation with Coverage\nTo enable code coverage, the project must be compiled with the options: -O0 -g --coverage and --coverage for linking.\n\nThe --coverage option is equivalent to -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage for GCC/Clang, in a classic project, it is preferable to use CMake presets rather than specifying the options manually.\nRunning Tests\nOnce the project is compiled, you can run the tests, this will generate files on which GCOVR relies to generate coverage reports:\n\n.gcno generated at compile time, contains metadata for coverage\n.gcda generated at runtime, contains the collected coverage data\n\n\nOptionDescription\n--test-dir buildSpecify the directory containing the tests\n--output-on-failureShow the output of failed tests\n--no-tests=errorGenerates an error if no tests are found\n--repeat until-fail:1Repeats the tests until a failure occurs, here 1 time\n--schedule-randomRuns the tests in random order\n--parallel 1Runs the tests in parallel, here 1 test at a time\n\nYou will get output similar to:\n\nHTML Report with GCOVR\nAfter running the tests, you can generate a coverage report with GCOVR, here we generate an HTML report to visualize the code coverage, but you can also generate reports in plain text, XML or JSON.\n\nOptionDescription\n--root \".\"Sets the root directory for coverage\n--decisionsIncludes coverage decisions in the report\n--callsIncludes function calls in the report\n--html-theme \"green\"Sets the HTML report theme to green\n--exclude \"tests/*\"Excludes test files from the report\n--exclude \"build/*\"Excludes build files from the report\n--exclude \"main.cpp\"Excludes the main.cpp file from the report\n--htmlGenerates an HTML report\n--html-detailsIncludes details in the HTML report\n--output \"build/coverage.html\"Specifies the output file name for the HTML report\n\nOnce the HTML report is generated, you can open it in your browser to visualize the code coverage, it should be generated in the file build/coverage.html.\nHere is the rendering of the report in the browser:\n Main Page\n Secondary Page\nXML or JSON Report\nYou can also generate a report in XML or JSON for integration with other tools:\n\nOr in JSON :\n\nCI/CD Integration\nYou can integrate code coverage generation into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate reports on each commit or merge request.\nHere is an example of a Gitlab CI to generate a coverage report and fail the pipeline if the coverage is below a certain threshold:\n\nSources\n\nGCOVR\nGoogle Test\n\n","description":"This tutorial shows how to set up

Kubernetes context to use Minikube:\n\nEnable and start kubelet service:\n\nDeploy Traefik with Helm\nLet's deploy Traefik using Helm, which is a package manager for Kubernetes.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can check the status of the traefik install:\n\nResult:\n\nYou can also check the status of services:\n\nYou should see output similar to this:\n\nThe NAME (traefik) must match to ingressClassName in the Ingress controller.\nYou can also check the ingress controller:\n\nResult:\n\nGet the Traefik service URL:\n\nResult:\n\nYou can check traefik pod in the traefik-tutorial namespace:\n\nResult:\n\nDeploy a sample application with Traefik\nYou can now deploy a sample application to test Traefik as a reverse proxy, we will deploy the whoami application, which is a simple HTTP server that returns information about the request it receives.\ntraefik.ingress.whoami.yml : Ingress define to route traffic to the whoami service.\n\nwhoami.deployment.yml : The Deployment specifies how the whoami application runs inside a pod.\n\nwhoami.services.yml : The Service specifies how the application is made accessible on the network.\n\nApply the Ingress, Deployment, and Service configurations:\n\nCheck the status of the pods to ensure they are running:\n\nYou should see whoami and traefik pods running in the traefik-tutorial namespace:\n\nNow you can access the whoami service through Traefik using the defined hostnames:\n\nResult:\n\nIf you access with your browser to http://whoami.192.168.49.2.nip.io:31134/, you should see the same result.\nYou may need to add the whoami.192.168.49.2.nip.io and whoami.bensuperpc.org domains to your /etc/hosts file or use a DNS service that resolves it to the Minikube IP address.\nScaling the application\nWe can now add more whoami instances, and Traefik will route the traffic automatically based on the Ingress rules defined.\nLet's scale the whoami deployment to 5 replicas:\n\nNow check the status of the pods again:\n\nYou should see multiple whoami pods running:\n\nYou can access the whoami service again, and it will now return responses from different pods, demonstrating that Traefik is load balancing the requests across the replicas.\n\nHostname and IP will change each time you call the service, as it will return the information from a different pod.\nRescale the whoami deployment back to 1 replica:\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler\nYou need to install the metrics server to use HPA. You can install it with the following command:\n\nNow update your whoami deployment to use HPA to automatically scale the number of replicas.\nwhoami.deployment.yml\n\nAdd the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration to automatically scale the whoami deployment.\nwhoami.hpa.yml\n\nApply the updated whoami deployment and HPA configuration:\n\nNow you can check the status of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:\n\nExpected result:\n\nClean up\nTo clean up the resources created during this tutorial, you can delete the Ingress, Deployment, and Service configurations, as well as the Traefik installation.\nUninstall helm chart:\n\nDelete all resources in the traefik-tutorial namespace and cleanup Minikube:\n\nMore info:\n\nTraefik documentation\nTraefik quick start\nDifference clusterip/nodeport/loadbalancer\nVoting application example\napi gateway autoscaling\n\n","description":"Deploy Traefik as a reverse proxy with Kubernetes","id":"https://blog.bensuperpc.org/tutorial/kubernetes/","title":"Deploy Traefik as a reverse proxy with Kubernetes"},"https://blog.bensuperpc.org/tutorial/rtl9210/":{"body":"RTL9210\nFirmware and tools for RTL9210 and RTL9210B USB to NVMe/SATA bridge controller.

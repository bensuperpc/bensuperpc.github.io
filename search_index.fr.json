de code en C/C++, avec CMake et GCOVR\nIntroduction\nCe tutoriel montre comment configurer un projet C/C++ avec CMake et GCOVR afin de gÃ©nÃ©rer des rapports de couverture de code, ce qui permet de vÃ©rifier prÃ©cisÃ©ment quelles parties du code source et quelles branches conditionnelles (if, switch...) sont effectivement couvertes par les tests.\nNous utiliserons un petit projet d'exemple basÃ© sur Google Test, mais la mÃ©thode est Ã©galement compatible avec d'autres frameworks comme Catch2, Boost.Test ou Doctest.\nExigences minimales\n\nCMake 3.15\nGCC ou Clang (C++17)\nGoogle Test (GTest)\nGCOVR 5.0\nNinja (optionnel, mais recommandÃ©)\n\nUne distribution comme Ubuntu 22.04, un Debian 12 ou supÃ©rieur est recommandÃ© dans le cadre de ce tutoriel, mais vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quelle distribution Linux avec les versions requises des outils.\nInstallation des dÃ©pendances\nPour installer les dÃ©pendances nÃ©cessaires, vous pouvez utiliser les commandes suivantes :\nPour Ubuntu/Debian :\n\nPour Fedora :\n\nPour Arch Linux :\n\nQu'est-ce que GCOVR ?\nGCOVR est un outil open source qui permet de gÃ©nÃ©rer des rapports de couverture de code C/C++ Ã  partir des donnÃ©es gÃ©nÃ©rÃ©es lors de l'exÃ©cution des tests.\nProjet d'exemple\nLe projet d'exemple est une simple application et deux bibliothÃ¨ques C++, une pour les mathÃ©matiques et une pour la physique.\nVoici lâarborescence du projet :\n\nVous pouvez tÃ©lÃ©charger le projet d'exemple: \n\n    tuto_coverage.7z\n\nCompilation avec couverture\nPour que la couverture de code fonctionne, le projet doit Ãªtre compilÃ© avec les options : -O0 -g3 --coverage et --coverage pour le linkage.\n\nL'option --coverage est Ã©quivalente Ã  -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage pour GCC/Clang, dans un projet classique, il est prÃ©fÃ©rable d'utiliser des presets CMake plutÃ´t que de spÃ©cifier les options manuellement.\nLes options -O0 et -g3 sont utilisÃ©es pour dÃ©sactiver les optimisations et inclure les informations de dÃ©bogage pour une couverture de code prÃ©cise.\nExÃ©cution des tests\nUne fois le projet compilÃ©, vous pouvez exÃ©cuter les tests, cela gÃ©nÃ©rera des fichiers sur lesquels GCOVR sâappuie pour gÃ©nÃ©rer les rapports de couverture:\n\n.gcno gÃ©nÃ©rÃ© Ã  la compilation, contient les mÃ©tadonnÃ©es pour la couverture\n.gcda gÃ©nÃ©rÃ© Ã  l'exÃ©cution, contient les donnÃ©es de couverture collectÃ©es\n\n\nOptionDescription\n--test-dir buildSpÃ©cifie le RÃ©pertoire contenant les tests\n--output-on-failureAffiche la sortie des tests Ã©chouÃ©s\n--no-tests=errorGÃ©nÃ¨re une erreur si aucun test n'est trouvÃ©\n--repeat until-fail:1RÃ©pÃ¨te les tests jusqu'Ã  ce qu'un Ã©chec se produise, ici 1 fois\n--schedule-randomFait exÃ©cuter les tests dans un ordre alÃ©atoire\n--parallel 1ExÃ©cute les tests en parallÃ¨le, ici 1 test Ã  la fois\n\nVous obtiendrez une sortie similaire Ã  :\n\nRapport HTML avec GCOVR\nAprÃ¨s l'exÃ©cution des tests, vous pouvez gÃ©nÃ©rer un rapport de couverture avec GCOVR, ici nous gÃ©nÃ©rons un rapport HTML pour visualiser la couverture de code, mais vous pouvez Ã©galement gÃ©nÃ©rer des rapports en texte brut, XML ou JSON.\n\nOptionDescription\n--root .DÃ©finit le rÃ©pertoire racine pour la couverture\n--decisionsInclut les dÃ©cisions de couverture dans le rapport\n--callsInclut les appels de fonction dans le rapport\n--html-theme \"green\"DÃ©finit le thÃ¨me du rapport HTML en vert\n--exclude \"tests/*\"Exclut les fichiers de test du rapport\n--exclude \"build/*\"Exclut les fichiers de build du rapport\n--exclude \"main.cpp\"Exclut le fichier main.cpp du rapport\n--htmlGÃ©nÃ¨re un rapport HTML\n--html-detailsInclut les dÃ©tails dans le rapport HTML\n--output \"build/coverage.html\"SpÃ©cifie le nom du fichier de sortie pour le rapport HTML\n\nGCovr va generer entre 5 fichiers dans le dossier build :\n\ncoverage.html : Rapport HTML principal\ncoverage.css : Fichier CSS pour le style du rapport HTML\ncoverage.functions.html : Rapport du nombre d'appels par fonction\ncoverage.math.cpp.xxxxxxx.html : Rapport de couverture pour le fichier math.cpp\ncoverage.physics.cpp.xxxxxxx.html : Rapport de couverture pour le fichier physics.cpp\n\nVous pouvez ouvrir build/coverage.html dans votre navigateur pour visualiser la couverture de code puis aller plus en dÃ©tail pour chaque fichier source.\nVoici le rendu du rapport sur le navigateur :\n Rapport de couverture GCovr montrant la couverture par fichier\n Page secondaire\nRapport en XML ou JSON\nVous pouvez Ã©galement gÃ©nÃ©rer un rapport en XML ou JSON pour une intÃ©gration avec d'autres outils :\n\nOu en JSON :\n\nCoverage dans CI/CD\nVous pouvez intÃ©grer la gÃ©nÃ©ration de rapports de couverture dans vos pipelines CI/CD avec GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD ou Jenkins.\nVoici un exemple de configuration pour Gitlab CI/CD :\n\nSources\n\nGCOVR\nGoogle Test\n\n","description":"Ce tutoriel montre comment configurer un

de code en C/C++, avec CMake et GCOVR\nIntroduction\nCe tutoriel montre comment configurer un projet C/C++ avec CMake et GCOVR afin de générer des rapports de couverture de code, cela permet de vérifier précisément quelles parties du code source et quelles branches conditionnelles (if, switch...) sont effectivement couvertes par les tests.\nNous utiliserons un petit projet d'exemple basé sur Google Test, mais la méthode est également compatible avec d'autres frameworks comme Catch2, Boost.Test ou Doctest.\nExigences minimales\n\nCMake 3.15\nGCC ou Clang (C++17)\nGoogle Test (GTest)\nGCOVR 5.0\nNinja (optionnel, mais recommandé)\n\nUne distribution comme Ubuntu 22.04, un Debian 12 ou supérieur est recommandé dans le cadre de ce tutoriel, mais vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quelle distribution Linux avec les versions requises des outils.\nInstallation des dépendances\nPour installer les dépendances nécessaires, vous pouvez utiliser les commandes suivantes :\nPour Ubuntu/Debian :\n\nPour Fedora :\n\nPour Arch Linux :\n\nQu'est-ce que GCOVR ?\nGCOVR est un outil open source qui permet de générer des rapports de couverture de code C/C++ à partir des données générées lors de l'exécution des tests.\nProjet d'exemple\nLe projet d'exemple est une simple application et deux bibliothèques C++, une pour les mathématiques et une pour la physique.\nVoici l’arborescence du projet :\n\nVous pouvez télécharger le projet d'exemple: \n\n    tuto_coverage.7z\n\nCompilation avec couverture\nPour que la couverture de code fonctionne, le projet doit être compilé avec les options : -O0 -g --coverage et --coverage pour le linkage.\n\nL'option --coverage est équivalente à -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage pour GCC/Clang, dans un projet classique, il est préférable d'utiliser des presets CMake plutôt que de spécifier les options manuellement.\nExécution des tests\nUne fois le projet compilé, vous pouvez exécuter les tests, cela générera des fichiers sur lesquels GCOVR s’appuie pour générer les rapports de couverture:\n\n.gcno généré à la compilation, contient les métadonnées pour la couverture\n.gcda généré à l'exécution, contient les données de couverture collectées\n\n\nOptionDescription\n--test-dir buildSpécifie le Répertoire contenant les tests\n--output-on-failureAffiche la sortie des tests échoués\n--no-tests=errorGénère une erreur si aucun test n'est trouvé\n--repeat until-fail:1Répète les tests jusqu'à ce qu'un échec se produise, ici 1 fois\n--schedule-randomFait exécuter les tests dans un ordre aléatoire\n--parallel 1Exécute les tests en parallèle, ici 1 test à la fois\n\nVous obtiendrez une sortie similaire à :\n\nRapport HTML avec GCOVR\nAprès l'exécution des tests, vous pouvez générer un rapport de couverture avec GCOVR, ici nous générons un rapport HTML pour visualiser la couverture de code, mais vous pouvez également générer des rapports en texte brut, XML ou JSON.\n\nOptionDescription\n--root \".\"Définit le répertoire racine pour la couverture\n--decisionsInclut les décisions de couverture dans le rapport\n--callsInclut les appels de fonction dans le rapport\n--html-theme \"green\"Définit le thème du rapport HTML en vert\n--exclude \"tests/*\"Exclut les fichiers de test du rapport\n--exclude \"build/*\"Exclut les fichiers de build du rapport\n--exclude \"main.cpp\"Exclut le fichier main.cpp du rapport\n--htmlGénère un rapport HTML\n--html-detailsInclut les détails dans le rapport HTML\n--output \"build/coverage.html\"Spécifie le nom du fichier de sortie pour le rapport HTML\n\nUne fois le rapport HTML généré, vous pouvez l'ouvrir dans votre navigateur pour visualiser la couverture de code, il devrait être généré dans le fichier build/coverage.html.\nVoici le rendu du rapport sur le navigateur :\n Page principale\n Page secondaire\nRapport en XML ou JSON\nVous pouvez également générer un rapport en XML ou JSON pour une intégration avec d'autres outils :\n\nOr in JSON :\n\nCI/CD Integration\nVous pouvez intégrer la génération de couverture de code à votre pipeline CI/CD afin de générer automatiquement des rapports pour chaque commit ou demande de fusion.\nVoici un exemple de GitLab CI pour générer un rapport de couverture et fail le pipeline si la couverture est inférieure à un certains seuils:\n\nSources\n\nGCOVR\nGoogle Test\n\n","description":"Ce tutoriel montre
